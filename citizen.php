				<p>Always follow the correct procedures. Never take shortcuts. Take responsibility and clean up if you made a mess. Clean and organize your workspace. Ensure a clear and easy route to emergency exits and equipment. Be alert and awake on the job. Be attentive at all times to your work surroundings. When in doubt, contact your supervisor or manager for instruction, guidance, or training. Never take risks when it comes to safety. Obey safety signs, stickers, and tags. Take short breaks when you keep up a repetitive motion for a long period of time, and sit, stand, or walk with good posture. Report serious injuries immediately to a supervisor and get emergency assistance. Keep things in perspective. Hazards may be limitless, so focus on the most likely risks first.</p><br>
 <b> 1. Prepare your family.</b><br><br>
                 <b> *Before The earthquake.</b><br>
                  <p>
            Now is the time to formulate a safety plan for you and your family. If you wait
until the earth starts to shake, it may be too late. Consider the following safety
measures:<br><br>
a) Always keep the following in a designated place: bottled drinking water, nonperishable
food (chura, gur, etc), first-aid kit, torchlight and battery-operated
radio with extra batteries.<br>
b) Teach family members how to turn off electricity, gas, etc.<br>
c) Identify places in the house that can provide cover during an earthquake.<br>
d) It may be easier to make long distance calls during an earthquake.
Identify an out-of-town relative or friend as your family’s emergency contact. If the
family members get separated after the earthquake and are not able to
contact each other, they should contact the designated relative/friend. The
address and phone number of the contact person/relative should be with all
the family members.<br><br>
<b>*If outdoors:</b>
<p>
            a) Move into the open, away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. Once
in the open, stay there until the shaking stops.<br>
b) If your home is badly damaged, you will have to leave. Collect water, food,
medicine, other essential items and important documents before leaving.<br>
c) Avoid places where there are loose electrical wires and do not touch metal
objects that are in touch with the loose wires.<br>
d) Do not re-enter damaged buildings and stay away from badly damaged
structures.<br><br></p>
<b>*If in a moving vehicle:</b>
<p>
            Move to a clear area away from buildings, trees, overpasses, or utility wires,
stop, and stay in the vehicle. Once the shaking has stopped, proceed with
caution. Avoid bridges or ramps that might have been damaged by the quake. <br><br>
          </p>





<b>*Safeguard your house</b>
<p>
            a) Consider retrofitting your house with earthquake-safety measures.Reinforcing the foundation and frame could make your house quake resistant.You may consult a reputable contractor and follow building codes.<br>
            b) Kutchha buildings can also be retrofitted and strengthened.<br><br>

          </p>
          <b>*During quake</b>
          <p>
            Earthquakes give no warning at all. Sometimes, a loud rumbling sound might
signal its arrival a few seconds ahead of time. Those few seconds could give you
a chance to move to a safer location. Here are some tips for keeping safe during
a quake.<br>

Take cover. Go under a table or other sturdy furniture; kneel, sit, or stay close
to the floor. Hold on to furniture legs for balance. Be prepared to move if your
cover moves.<br>
a) If no sturdy cover is nearby, kneel or sit close to the floor next to a structurally
sound interior wall. Place your hands on the floor for balance.<br>
b) Do not stand in doorways. Violent motion could cause doors to slam and
cause serious injuries. You may also be hit be flying objects.<br>
c) Move away from windows, mirrors, bookcases and other unsecured heavy
objects.<br>
d) If you are in bed, stay there and cover yourself with pillows and blankets.<br>
e) Do not run outside if you are inside. Never use the lift.<br>
f) If you are living in a kutcha house, the best thing to do is to move to an open
area where there are no trees, electric or telephone wires.<br><br>
                
<b>*After the quake</b>
<p>
            Here are a few things to keep in mind after an earthquake. The caution you
display in the aftermath can be essential for your personal safety.<br>
a) Wear shoes/chappals to protect your feet from debris.<br>
b) After the first tremor, be prepared for aftershocks. Though less intense,
aftershocks cause additional damages and may bring down weakened
structures. Aftershocks can occur in the first hours, days, weeks, or even
months after the quake.<br>
c) Check for fire hazards and use torchlights instead of candles or lanterns.<br>
d) If the building you live in is in a good shape after the earthquake, stay inside
and listen for radio advises. If you are not certain about the damage to your
building, evacuate carefully. Do not touch downed power line.<br>
e) Help injured or trapped persons. Give first aid where appropriate. Do not
move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further
injury. In such cases, call for help.<br>
f) Remember to help your neighbours who may require special assistanceinfants,
the elderly, and people with disabilities.<br>
g) Listen to a battery-operated radio for the latest emergency information.
 Stay out of damaged buildings.<br>
h) Return home only when authorities say it is safe. Clean up spilled medicines,
bleaches or gasoline or other flammable liquids immediately. Leave the area
if you smell gas or fumes from other chemicals. Open closet and cupboard
doors cautiously.<br>
i) If you smell gas or hear hissing noise, open windows and quickly leave the
building. Turn off the switch on the top of the gas cylinder.<br>
j) Look for electrical system damages - if you see sparks, broken wires, or if
you smell burning of amber, turn off electricity at the main fuse box. If you
have to step in water to get to the fuse box, call an electrician first for advice.<br>
k) Check for sewage and water lines damage. If you suspect sewage lines are
damaged, avoid using the toilets. If water pipes are damaged, avoid using
water from the tap.<br>
l) Use the telephone only for emergency calls.<br>
m) In case family members are separated from one another during an
earthquake (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and
children are at school), develop a plan for reuniting after the disaster. Ask an
out of state / district relative or friend to serve as the “family contact”. Make
sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number(s)
of the contact person (s).

 <b> 1. Prepare your family.</b><br><br>
 <b>*Do's and Don'ts - Cold Wave</b><br><br>
                 <p> a)Stay indoors as much as possible.<br>
b) Check that you have adequate winter clothing.<br>
c) Monitor all media outlets for weather and
emergency procedure information.<br>
d) Check on any neighbours who live alone, especially
the elderly.<br>
e) Ensure emergency supplies are easily accessible-no
power means-no electricity.<br>
f) Use only one room-an internal room or passage will
be easier to heat.<br>
g) Regular hot drinks will maintain body heat to fight
the cold.<br>
h) If electricity fails, freezers will preserve food for up

Report serious injuries immediately to a supervisor and get emergency assistance. Keep things in perspective. Hazards may be limitless, so focus on the most likely risks first.</p><br>
 <b> 1. Prepare your family.</b><br><br>


 <b>*During a Landslide:</b><br><br>
                 <p> a)Stay alert and awake. Many debris-flow fatalities occur when people are sleeping. Listen
to a Weather Radio or portable, battery-powered radio or television for warnings of
intense rainfall. Be aware that intense, short bursts of rain may be particularly dangerous,
especially after longer periods of heavy rainfall and damp weather.<br>
b) If you are in areas susceptible to landslides and debris flows, consider leaving if it is safe
to do so. Remember that driving during an intense storm can be hazardous. If you remain
at home, move to a second story if possible. Staying out of the path of a landslide or
debris flow saves lives.<br>
c) Listen for any unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking
or boulders knocking together. A trickle of flowing or falling mud or debris may precede
larger landslides. Moving debris can flow quickly and sometimes without warning.<br>
d) If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water
flow and for a change from clear to muddy water. Such changes may indicate landslide
activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. Don't delay! Save yourself, not your
belongings.<br>
e) Be especially alert when driving. Embankments along roadsides are particularly
susceptible to landslides. Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and
other indications of possible debris flows. 
</p><br>
<b>*What to Do if You Suspect Imminent Landslide Danger:</b><br><br>
<p>a)Contact your local fire, police, or public works department. Local officials are the best
persons able to assess potential danger.<br>
b) Inform affected neighbors. Your neighbors may not be aware of potential hazards.<br>
Advising them of a potential threat may help save lives. Help neighbors who may need
assistance to evacuate.<br>
c) Evacuate. Getting out of the path of a landslide or debris flow is your best protection</p><br>

<b>*Media and Community Education Ideas:</b><br><br>
<p>a)In an area prone to landslides, publish a special newspaper section with emergency
information on landslides and debris flows. Localize the information by including the
phone numbers of local emergency services offices, the Red Cross, and hospitals.<br>
b) Report on what city and county governments are doing to reduce the possibility of
landslides. Interview local officials about local land- use zoning regulations.<br>
c) Interview local officials and major insurers. Find out if debris flow is covered by flood
insurance policies and contact your local emergency management office to learn more
about the program.<br>
d) Work with local emergency services to prepare special reports for people with mobility
impairments on what to do if evacuation is ordered.<br>
e) Support your local government in efforts to develop and enforce land-use and building
ordinances that regulate construction in areas susceptible to landslides and debris flows.
Buildings should be located away from steep slopes, streams and rivers, intermittentstream
channels, and the mouths of mountain channels.  </p><br>


<b>*After the Landslide:</b><br><br>
<p>a)Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides.
b) Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide
area. Direct rescuers to their locations.<br>
c) Help a neighbor who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and people
with disabilities. Elderly people and people with disabilities may require additional
assistance. People who care for them or who have large families may need additional
assistance in emergency situations.<br>
d) Listen to local radio or television stations for the latest emergency information.
e) Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes
follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event.
f) Look for and report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential
hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard
and injury.<br>
g) Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Damage to
foundations, chimneys, or surrounding land may help you assess the safety of the area.
h) Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground
cover can lead to flash flooding.<br>
i) Seek the advice of a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing
corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional will be able to advise you
of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.
 </p><br>

<b>*Media and Community Education Ideas:</b><br><br>
<p>a)· In an area prone to landslides, publish a special newspaper section with emergency
information on landslides and debris flows. Localize the information by including the
phone numbers of local emergency services offices, the American Red Cross chapter, and
hospitals.<br>
b) Report on what city and county governments are doing to reduce the possibility of
landslides. Interview local officials about local land- use zoning regulations.<br>
c) Interview local officials and major insurers regarding the National Flood Insurance
Program. Find out if debris flow is covered by flood insurance policies from the National
Flood Insurance Program and contact your local emergency management office to learn
more about the program.<br>
d) Work with local emergency to prepare special reports for people with mobility
impairments on what to do if evacuation is ordered.<br>
e) Support your local government in efforts to develop and enforce land-use and building
ordinances that regulate construction in areas susceptible to landslides and debris flows.
Buildings should be located away from steep slopes, streams and rivers, intermittentstream
channels, and the mouths of mountain channels. 
 </p><br>

 <b>*Before a Landslide: How to Plan:</b><br><br>
<p>a)·Develop a Family Disaster Plan. Please see the "Family Disaster Plan" section for general family
planning information. Develop landslide-specific planning.<br>
b)Learn about landslide risk in your area. Contact local officials, state geological surveys or
departments of natural resources, and university departments of geology. Landslides occur where
they have before, and in identifiable hazard locations. Ask for information on landslides in your
area, specific information on areas vulnerable to landslides, and request a professional referral
for a very detailed site analysis of your property, and corrective measures you can take, if
necessary.
 
 </p><br>
 <b>*If you are at risk from landslides:</b><br><br>
<p>a)Talk to your insurance agent.<br>
b) Develop an evacuation plan.<br>
c) Discuss landslides and debris flow with your family. Everyone should know what to do
in case all family members are not together. Discussing disaster ahead of time helps
reduce fear and lets everyone know how to respond during a landslide or debris flow.

<b>*Areas that are generally prone to landslides</b><br><br>
                 <p>a)Old and/or recent existing landslides.<br>
b) Base or top of slopes.<br>
c) Base of minor drainage hollows.<br>
d) Base or top of an old fill slope.<br>
e) Base or top of a steep cut slope.<br>
</p>
<b>*Areas generally safe from landslides</b><br>
<p>a)Hard, non-jointed bedrock that has not moved in the past.<br>
b) Flat-lying areas away from slopes and steep river banks.<br>
c) The nose of ridges, set back from the tops of slopes.</p><br>

<b>*Landslide warning signs</b><br>
<p>a)Sticking or jamming of doors or windows.<br>
b) Appearance of cracks in plaster, tile, brick, or foundations.<br>
c) Pulling away from the building of outside walls or stairs.<br>
d) Slow development of widening cracks on the ground or on paved areas such as streets.<br>
e) Breakage of underground utility lines.<br>
f) Appearance of bulging ground at the base of a slope.<br>
g) Emergence of flowing ground water in new sites.<br>
h) Sudden decrease in creek water levels though rain is still falling or just recently stopped.<br>
i) Tilting or moving of fences, retaining walls, utility poles, or trees.<br>
j) Faint rumbling sound that increases in volume as the landslide nears.The ground slopes
downward in one specific direction and may begin shifting in that direction under your
feet. </p><br>
<b>*Immediate steps for imminent Landslide</b><br>
<p>a)Contact Contact your local fire, police or public works department.<br>
b) Inform affected neighbors.<br>
c) Leave the area quickly. </p><br>

<b>*Actions to be taken before Intense Rainfall</b><br>
<p>a)Become familiar with the land around you. Slopes where landslides or debris flows have
occurred in the past are likely to experience them in the future.<br>
b) Buildings should be located away from known landslides, debris flows, steep slopes,<br>
streams and rivers, intermittent-stream channels, and the mouths of mountain channels.<br>
c) Observe the patterns of storm-water drainage on slopes near your home, and watch
especially the places were runoff water converges, increasing flow over soil-covered 
slopes. Observe the hillsides around your home for any signs of land movement, such as
small landslides or debris flows or progressively tilting trees.<br>
d) Contact your local authorities to learn about the disaster management response, and
develop your own emergency plans for your family and business.</p><br>

<b>*During Intense Rainfall</b><br>
<p>a)Be observant. Many landslide and debris flow fatalities occur when people are sleeping.
Listen to radio for warnings of intense rainfall. Intense short bursts of rain may be
particularly dangerous, especially after longer periods of heavy rainfall and damp
weather.<br>
b) Unusual sounds might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders
knocking together. A trickle of flowing or falling mud or debris may precede larger
landslides. Be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow in streams or
channels. Such changes may indicate landslide activity upstream, so be prepared to
move quickly.<br>
c) If you live in areas susceptible to landslides and debris flows, consider leaving if it is safe
to do so. If you remain at home, move to a part of the house farthest away from the
source of the landslide or debris flows, such as an upper floor, but keep an escape route
open should it become necessary to leave the house.<br>
d) Be alert when on the roads. Embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to
landslides. Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other
indications of possible landslides or debris flows. 
</p><br>

<b>*After Intense Rainfall</b><br>
<p>a) Be alert for signs indicating land movement. Landslides can occur weeks or months after
intense storms. 
</p>

<b>*Things to Remember </b><br>
<p>a)Mudflows tend to flow in channels, but will often spread out over a floodplain. They
generally occur in places where they have occurred before.<br>
b) Landslide and mudflows usually strike without warning. The force of rocks, soil, or other
debris moving down a slope can devastate anything in its path. Take the following steps
to be ready.<br>
c) Plant ground cover on slopes and build retaining walls.<br>
d) In mudflow areas, build channels or deflection walls to direct the flow around buildings.
d) Remember: If you build walls to divert debris flow and the flow lands on a neighbor's
property, you may be liable for damages.
</p><br>

<b>*Precautions to be taken during landslides</b><br><br>
<b>If inside a building:</b><br>
<p>a)Stay inside.<br>
b) Take cover under a desk, table, or other piece of sturdy furniture. </p><br>

<b>*If outdoors: </b><br>
<p>a)Try and get out of the path of the landslide or mudflow.<br>
b) Run to the nearest high ground in a direction away from the path.<br>
c) If rocks and other debris are approaching, run for the nearest shelter such as a group of
trees or a building.<br>
d) If escape is not possible, curl into a tight ball and protect your head. </p><br>

<b>*After Landslide</b><br>
<p>a)Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides.<br>
b) Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide area. Give first aid if trained.<br>
c) Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance--infants, elderly
people, and people with disabilities.<br>
d) Listen to a battery-operated radio or television for the latest emergency information.<br>
e) Remember that flooding may occur after a mudflow or a landslide.<br>
f) Check for damaged utility lines. Report any damage to the utility company.<br>
g) Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage.<br>
h) Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground
cover can lead to flash flooding.

				<p>Always follow the correct procedures. Never take shortcuts. Take responsibility and clean up if you made a mess. Clean and organize your workspace. Ensure a clear and easy route to emergency exits and equipment. Be alert and awake on the job. Be attentive at all times to your work surroundings. When in doubt, contact your supervisor or manager for instruction, guidance, or training. Never take risks when it comes to safety. Obey safety signs, stickers, and tags. Take short breaks when you keep up a repetitive motion for a long period of time, and sit, stand, or walk with good posture. Report serious injuries immediately to a supervisor and get emergency assistance. Keep things in perspective. Hazards may be limitless, so focus on the most likely risks first.</p><br>

 <b> 1. Prepare your family.</b><br><br>
                 <b> *Before The earthquake.</b><br>
                  <p>
            Now is the time to formulate a safety plan for you and your family. If you wait
until the earth starts to shake, it may be too late. Consider the following safety
measures:<br><br>
a) Always keep the following in a designated place: bottled drinking water, nonperishable
food (chura, gur, etc), first-aid kit, torchlight and battery-operated
radio with extra batteries.<br>
b) Teach family members how to turn off electricity, gas, etc.<br>
c) Identify places in the house that can provide cover during an earthquake.<br>
d) It may be easier to make long distance calls during an earthquake.
Identify an out-of-town relative or friend as your family’s emergency contact. If the
family members get separated after the earthquake and are not able to
contact each other, they should contact the designated relative/friend. The
address and phone number of the contact person/relative should be with all
the family members.<br><br>
<b>*If outdoors:</b>
<p>
            a) Move into the open, away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. Once
in the open, stay there until the shaking stops.<br>
b) If your home is badly damaged, you will have to leave. Collect water, food,
medicine, other essential items and important documents before leaving.<br>
c) Avoid places where there are loose electrical wires and do not touch metal
objects that are in touch with the loose wires.<br>
d) Do not re-enter damaged buildings and stay away from badly damaged
structures.<br><br></p>
<b>*If in a moving vehicle:</b>
<p>
            Move to a clear area away from buildings, trees, overpasses, or utility wires,
stop, and stay in the vehicle. Once the shaking has stopped, proceed with
caution. Avoid bridges or ramps that might have been damaged by the quake. <br><br>
          </p>





<b>*Safeguard your house</b>
<p>
            a) Consider retrofitting your house with earthquake-safety measures.Reinforcing the foundation and frame could make your house quake resistant.You may consult a reputable contractor and follow building codes.<br>
            b) Kutchha buildings can also be retrofitted and strengthened.<br><br>

          </p>
          <b>*During quake</b>
          <p>
            Earthquakes give no warning at all. Sometimes, a loud rumbling sound might
signal its arrival a few seconds ahead of time. Those few seconds could give you
a chance to move to a safer location. Here are some tips for keeping safe during
a quake.<br>

Take cover. Go under a table or other sturdy furniture; kneel, sit, or stay close
to the floor. Hold on to furniture legs for balance. Be prepared to move if your
cover moves.<br>
a) If no sturdy cover is nearby, kneel or sit close to the floor next to a structurally
sound interior wall. Place your hands on the floor for balance.<br>
b) Do not stand in doorways. Violent motion could cause doors to slam and
cause serious injuries. You may also be hit be flying objects.<br>
c) Move away from windows, mirrors, bookcases and other unsecured heavy
objects.<br>
d) If you are in bed, stay there and cover yourself with pillows and blankets.<br>
e) Do not run outside if you are inside. Never use the lift.<br>
f) If you are living in a kutcha house, the best thing to do is to move to an open
area where there are no trees, electric or telephone wires.<br><br>
                
<b>*After the quake</b>
<p>
            Here are a few things to keep in mind after an earthquake. The caution you
display in the aftermath can be essential for your personal safety.<br>
a) Wear shoes/chappals to protect your feet from debris.<br>
b) After the first tremor, be prepared for aftershocks. Though less intense,
aftershocks cause additional damages and may bring down weakened
structures. Aftershocks can occur in the first hours, days, weeks, or even
months after the quake.<br>
c) Check for fire hazards and use torchlights instead of candles or lanterns.<br>
d) If the building you live in is in a good shape after the earthquake, stay inside
and listen for radio advises. If you are not certain about the damage to your
building, evacuate carefully. Do not touch downed power line.<br>
e) Help injured or trapped persons. Give first aid where appropriate. Do not
move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further
injury. In such cases, call for help.<br>
f) Remember to help your neighbours who may require special assistanceinfants,
the elderly, and people with disabilities.<br>
g) Listen to a battery-operated radio for the latest emergency information.
 Stay out of damaged buildings.<br>
h) Return home only when authorities say it is safe. Clean up spilled medicines,
bleaches or gasoline or other flammable liquids immediately. Leave the area
if you smell gas or fumes from other chemicals. Open closet and cupboard
doors cautiously.<br>
i) If you smell gas or hear hissing noise, open windows and quickly leave the
building. Turn off the switch on the top of the gas cylinder.<br>
j) Look for electrical system damages - if you see sparks, broken wires, or if
you smell burning of amber, turn off electricity at the main fuse box. If you
have to step in water to get to the fuse box, call an electrician first for advice.<br>
k) Check for sewage and water lines damage. If you suspect sewage lines are
damaged, avoid using the toilets. If water pipes are damaged, avoid using
water from the tap.<br>
l) Use the telephone only for emergency calls.<br>
m) In case family members are separated from one another during an
earthquake (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and
children are at school), develop a plan for reuniting after the disaster. Ask an
out of state / district relative or friend to serve as the “family contact”. Make
sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number(s)
of the contact person (s).
